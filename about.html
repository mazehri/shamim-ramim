		<h3> ABOUT "GLADWYNE'S IRON COMPANY"</h3>
		<p>
		Iron was smelted from the ore in a blast furnace and the molten iron allowed to run 
		from the furnace into a bed of sand.There were shallow gutters shaped in the sand with
		several channels diverting from the main gutter to form a herringbone pattern.The iron
		was allowed to set hard in these channels. The iron could then be broken into manageable 
		pieces for re-work.These channels were said to resemble the shape of a sow suckling her
		litter, so the iron was given the name "pig iron".This type of iron was high in carbon 
        and therefore very brittle when solid.It could not be hammered, but it could be re-melted
		and cast into moulds and also heat treated to make it even harderand more wear resistant. 
		This became known as "CAST IRON"
